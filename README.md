# Welcome to the StoryEngine Repo!

StoryEngine is way to listen to, support, and create with the people who matter most to an organization or a cause. It can be used to do research, to monitor or evaluate a program, to generate learning, or facilitate grant reporting. StoryEngine is based in-depth interviews that get transformed into stories. These stories are assets — for communications, advocacy, and more — as well as data. Together the stories create a larger dataset that can be analyzed to surface insights and learning that inform decision-making. Check out our [StoryEngine repository](https://Storyengine.io)!

# Who might use StoryEngine?

StoryEngine can generate value across an organization — as well as for the participants. User profiles \(some tested, others in development\) are listed below. Note that StoryEngine can serve multiple people and purposes at the same time. For example, the process of collecting the data needed for an assessment can provide valuable assets for leadership, fundraising, and advocacy teams — with the added bonus of potentially getting different parts of the organization onto the same page.

## User profiles

* Leaders with organizational development, learning, and innovation agendas
* Participants / Interviewees — people the organization serves, including partners, volunteers, and members
* Network- / member-driven organizations, including associations 
* Designers of programs, services, products, and experiences 
* Evaluation, assessment, and learning and insights teams
* Grant writers and development teams
* Communications professionals, including advocacy, marketing, and public relations 
* Funders and grant managers 
* Conference organizers and attendees 
* Recruiting and onboarding / human resources teams 

For more detail on each of these use cases, read the Introduction to the [StoryEngine Guide](https://loup.gitbooks.io/storyengine/content/).

# Where are we now?

StoryEngine was developed by [Loup](https://loup.design) for the [Mozilla Foundation](https://mozilla.org). The pilot phase is now complete, as well as the initial documentation for others to use and adapt. Mozilla has institutionalized key StoryEngine practices and narratives will be shared via Mozilla Pulse. Loup will continue to steward StoryEngine’s development, and is currently using it with other organizations. See the [Learning and History](https://loup.gitbooks.io/storyengine/content/learning.html) chapter in the StoryEngine Guide to learn more.
