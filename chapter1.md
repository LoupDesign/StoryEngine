StoryEngine is designed to be an ongoing process — a loop. It is flexible and adaptive, with room for improvement and customization. We encourage anyone who uses the methodology to adapt it to best serve your needs.

You’re listening and testing throughout the process, with the goal of building stronger and more systematic feedback loops with the people you serve.
